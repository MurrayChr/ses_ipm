Data and code for "Robustly estimating the demographic contribution of immigration: simulation, sensitivity analysis and seals" by Christian, Oosthuizen, Bester and de Bruyn.

All data, R and Stan code are in the folders of the same name; fitted models and tLTRE analyses are in `outputs`, posterior replicate datasets for goodness-of-fit are in `ppc_rep_data` and figures are in `figs`.

See the READMEs in the `R` and `stan` folders for further details.  

### Installing cmdstanr
We run Stan using cmdstanr; instructions on how to install cmdstanr can be found [here](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html).
